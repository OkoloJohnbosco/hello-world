# hello-world

Hi Geeks,

I'm Johnbosco,a frontend developer or should i say a beginner(as my mama always say if u want to become something lets say a lawyer call yourself a lawyer and go for it with all ounce of muscle in your and when u get there aim higher) but i actually want to become a fullstack developer but first things first.
